# @south-paw/koa-typescript

♨️ Simple boilerplate for a Koa server with Typescript, ESLint, Prettier and Jest.

## About

Unlike some of the other Koa boilerplates out there, this one is intended to be simple, minimalistic and reasonably unopinionated.

- Typescript, ESLint, Prettier and Jest are ready to roll
- Config has `.env` file support
- Simple `/health` route implemented

You don't need to keep anything as you find it and hopefully it will save you a little time when you need a quick boilerplate for that next Koa project.

If you think theres some kind of improvement to be made, please raise a ticket or make a pull request.
